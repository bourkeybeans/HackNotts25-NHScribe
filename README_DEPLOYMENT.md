## 🚀 Deployment Steps (Detailed)

### Step 1: Transfer Project to Pi

From your Mac terminal:

```bash
scp -r /Users/farhan/Documents/HackNotts25/HackNotts25 pi@10.249.84.213:~/
```

*This copies all files to the Pi's home directory.*

### Step 2: Start Backend Service

SSH into your Pi:

```bash
ssh pi@10.249.84.213
```

Navigate to project and start backend:

```bash
cd ~/HackNotts25
./start_backend.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Starting NHScribe Backend...
📍 Server will be accessible at http://10.249.84.213:8000
...
✅ Starting FastAPI server...
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

✅ **Leave this terminal running** - don't close it!

### Step 3: Start Frontend Service

Open a **new terminal** and SSH again:

```bash
ssh pi@10.249.84.213
```

Navigate to frontend and start:

```bash
cd ~/HackNotts25/front-end
./start_frontend.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
🎨 Starting NHScribe Frontend...
📍 Frontend will be accessible at http://10.249.84.213:3000
...
webpack compiled successfully
```

✅ **Leave this terminal running too!**

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

Open a **third terminal** (optional but recommended):

```bash
ssh pi@10.249.84.213
cd ~/HackNotts25
./test_deployment.sh
```

This will automatically test all endpoints and confirm everything is working.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cannot reach http://10.249.84.213:3000

**Solutions:**
1. Check if Pi is on network: `ping 10.249.84.213`
2. Verify services are running: `ps aux | grep -E 'python|node'`
3. Check firewall: `sudo ufw allow 8000 && sudo ufw allow 3000`
4. Restart services (Ctrl+C in terminal, then run start scripts again)

### Problem: CORS errors in browser console

**Solutions:**
1. Open browser console (F12) and check exact error
2. Verify backend is running
3. Check that `app.py` has CORS configured (should already be set)
4. Try clearing browser cache

### Problem: "Failed to fetch" errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify backend is responding: `curl http://10.249.84.213:8000/patients/`
2. Check `config.js` has correct IP address
3. Make sure both backend AND frontend are running
4. Check network connectivity

### Problem: Backend crashes on startup

**Solutions:**
1. Check Python version: `python3 --version` (need 3.8+)
2. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check if port 8000 is already in use: `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 8000`
4. Look at error messages in terminal

### Problem: Frontend won't start

**Solutions:**
1. Check Node version: `node --version` (need 16+)
2. Delete and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check if port 3000 is in use: `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 3000`
4. Try: `npm cache clean --force && npm install`

✅ Backend responds at http://10.249.84.213:8000  
✅ Frontend loads at http://10.249.84.213:3000  
✅ Can access from other devices on network  
✅ Can create patients  
✅ Can upload CSV files  
✅ Can generate letters  
✅ Can view/edit/download letters  
✅ No errors in browser console  
✅ Test script passes all tests

## 🔄 Making It Permanent (Optional)

### Option 1: Using PM2 (Recommended)

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start backend
pm2 start app.py --name nhscribe-backend --interpreter python3

# Build and start frontend
cd front-end
npm run build
pm2 serve build 3000 --name nhscribe-frontend

# Save configuration
pm2 save
pm2 startup  # Follow the instructions it prints
```

Now services will:
- ✅ Auto-restart if they crash
- ✅ Start automatically on boot
- ✅ Run in the background
- ✅ Have logging enabled

### Option 2: Using systemd

Create service files (advanced - see DEPLOYMENT.md for details)

## 📊 Configuration Reference

### Default Settings

| Setting | Value | Can Change? |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Pi IP Address | 10.249.84.213 | ✅ Yes (edit config.js) |
| Backend Port | 8000 | ⚠️ Yes (requires multiple changes) |
| Frontend Port | 3000 | ⚠️ Yes (requires multiple changes) |
| Database | SQLite (scribe.db) | ⚠️ Advanced |
| AI Model | Llama 3 | ⚠️ Advanced |

### To Change IP Address

If your Pi's IP changes, update **one file**:

```bash
nano ~/HackNotts25/front-end/src/config.js
```

Change:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://NEW_IP_HERE:8000';
```

Then restart frontend:
```bash
cd ~/HackNotts25/front-end
./start_frontend.sh
```

---

## 🎓 Understanding the Setup

### Why These Changes?

1. **CORS Configuration** - Allows browser requests from network devices
2. **API Base URL** - Centralizes IP configuration for easy updates
3. **0.0.0.0 Host** - Makes server accessible on network, not just localhost
4. **Start Scripts** - Automates dependency installation and service startup

### Security Notes

⚠️ **Current setup is for local networks only:**
- CORS allows all origins (`*`)
- No authentication required
- HTTP (not HTTPS)

✅ **Fine for:**
- Home networks
- Office LANs
- Development
- Trusted environments

❌ **Not suitable for:**
- Internet-facing deployments
- Public access
- Untrusted networks

For production internet deployment, you'll need to add authentication, HTTPS, and proper CORS restrictions.
